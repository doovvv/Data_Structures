The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a string-matching 
algorithm that searches for occurrences of a pattern string 
within a larger text string. It works by pre-processing the 
pattern string to determine the longest proper prefix that 
is also a suffix of each substring of the pattern. This 
information is then used during the actual search to avoid 
unnecessary comparisons and quickly skip over non-matching 
sections of the text. 

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the KMP algorithm, 
we will use it to search for a specific pattern within a 
large collection of documents. The pattern we are searching 
for is "Lorem ipsum", a common placeholder text used in the 
design industry. By using the KMP algorithm, we can efficiently 
locate all occurrences of this pattern within our document 
collection, without the need for manual searching or 
brute-force techniques. 

The KMP algorithm is widely used in applications that require 
efficient string matching, such as text editors, compilers, 
and data compression tools. Its ability to quickly identify
patterns within large datasets makes it a valuable tool for
both developers and end-users alike. By understanding the 
inner workings of the KMP algorithm, we can gain a greater 
appreciation for the power and versatility of modern computer 
algorithms
